## Hi there 👋
My name is Behnaz Nojavanasghari and I am a lead machine learning scientist. I am experienced in leading and developing machine learning projects from conception through finished, shippable products in user modeling, NLP, multimodal machine learning and computer vision domains. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and I am passionate about building data-driven products and bringing creative ideas to life. I enjoy working with different teams and serving as the ”translation layer” between cross functional stakeholders. I love building high performing teams and helping team members to discover their strengths and find challenges for them to gain new skills.
